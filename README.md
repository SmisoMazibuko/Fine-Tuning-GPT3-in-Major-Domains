# Fine-Tuning GPT3 in Major Domains.

This repository contains datasets that can be used to fine-tune GPT3 model for various domains such as science, business, and arts. The goal is to improve the language model's performance in these domains and make it more versatile.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Download the datasets and place them in the appropriate folders
3. Use the datasets to fine-tune the GPT3 model
4. Evaluate the results and compare it with the base GPT3 model

## Datasets

The datasets have been curated from various sources and are split into the following categories:

- Science
- Business
- Arts

Each category contains relevant datasets that are specific to that domain.
